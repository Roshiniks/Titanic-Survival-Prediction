# 📊 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle, analyzing what factors influenced the survival of passengers using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

---

## 🚢 Project Objective

The goal is to:
- Clean and understand the dataset
- Perform EDA to identify key survival indicators
- Visualize insights using Python libraries

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset used: `train.csv` from the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- Survival distribution by gender, class, age
- Null value handling and data imputation
- Feature-wise comparison between survivors and non-survivors
- Visualization of relationships between key features and survival

---

## 📷 Sample Visuals

Some insights visualized:
- Survival rate by gender
- Survival by passenger class
- Age distribution of survivors
- Correlation heatmap

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- **Females** had a much higher survival rate than males
- **First-class** passengers had better chances of survival
- Younger passengers were more likely to survive
